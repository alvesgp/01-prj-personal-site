    <p class="bio">
      Hello! I am a bioinformatics student with a concentration in computational sciences and a minor in computer science.<br>
      I am currently learning web development with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
      I am also interested in data science and using technology to solve real-world problems.<br>
      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, taking care of my pets, and spending time with my friends and family.<br>
      I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.<br>
      I am excited to share my journey with you and hope to inspire others to pursue their passions in technology and science.<br>
